        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
        
        <div class="terms-content">
            <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY.</strong> By accessing or using the AfriGate platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all terms incorporated by reference.</p>

            <h3>1. ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT</h3>
            <p>This Agreement constitutes a binding legal contract between you ("User") and AfriGate ("Company"). If you do not agree to these terms, you must immediately cease all use of our services. Your continued use of the platform signifies your irrevocable acceptance of these terms and any future modifications.</p>

            <h3>2. ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNT AGE</h3>
            <p>Our services are specifically designed for the African and international markets. You must be at least <strong>16 years of age</strong> to create an account. By registering, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement under the laws of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

            <h3>3. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) & KYC</h3>
            <p>AfriGate maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding financial crimes. 
                <br>• <strong>Initial Verification:</strong> All users must submit valid government-issued identification.
                <br>• <strong>Mandatory Renewal:</strong> KYC documentation must be <strong>renewed every 12 months</strong>. Failure to update records will result in immediate restriction of withdrawal privileges.
                <br>• <strong>Monitoring:</strong> We reserve the right to monitor all transactions for suspicious patterns and report them to the relevant authorities in the DRC without prior notice to the user.</p>

            <h3>4. CRYPTOCURRENCY RISK DISCLOSURE</h3>
            <p>Trading in digital assets involves significant risk. Prices can fluctuate widely in a very short period. 
                <br>• AfriGate is not a financial advisor. 
                <br>• You acknowledge that cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government or central bank. 
                <br>• <strong>Transfer Errors:</strong> Sending assets to the wrong wallet address (e.g., sending BTC to an ETH address) will result in the permanent loss of funds. AfriGate cannot recover these assets.</p>

            <h3>5. TRANSACTION FEES AND MODIFICATIONS</h3>
            <p>All services provided by the platform are subject to a fee schedule. 
                <br>• Fees will be clearly stated on the transaction confirmation page. 
                <br>• The Company reserves the right to adjust fee structures at any time based on network congestion or market conditions. 
                <br>• Your confirmation of a transaction constitutes final agreement to the displayed fee.</p>

            <h3>6. SECURITY, HACKING, AND REFUND POLICY</h3>
            <p>Users are responsible for implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and protecting their private keys/passwords. 
                <br>• <strong>Limited Liability:</strong> The Company is not liable for losses resulting from user-side security breaches (phishing, shared passwords).
                <br>• <strong>Discretionary Refunds:</strong> In the event of a platform-wide security incident, the management may, at its sole discretion, evaluate a <strong>partial refund percentage</strong>. This is not a guarantee and will be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <h3>7. SERVICE AVAILABILITY AND MAINTENANCE</h3>
            <p>We strive to provide 24/7 service; however, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. Scheduled maintenance or emergency security patches may result in temporary downtime. AfriGate is not liable for any "opportunity cost" or perceived losses during these periods.</p>

            <h3>8. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES</h3>
            <p>You agree not to use the platform for:
                <br>• Illegal gambling, money laundering, or financing of terrorism.
                <br>• Attempting to circumvent the platform's security features.
                <br>• Using any automated bot or "scraper" to access platform data without authorization.</p>

            <h3>9. TERMINATION AND ACCOUNT BLOCKING</h3>
            <p>AfriGate reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the platform and to block or prevent your future access. This applies specifically to accounts involved in fraudulent activity or violations of these terms.</p>

            <h3>10. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>
            <p>This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of it shall be governed by and terminal in accordance with the <strong>laws of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC)</strong>. All legal proceedings shall take place in the courts of Kinshasa.</p>

            <h3>11. FORCE MAJEURE</h3>
            <p>AfriGate shall not be liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to: acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, or strikes.</p>
